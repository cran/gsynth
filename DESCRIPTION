Title: Generalized Synthetic Control Method
Version: 1.0.5
Date: 2017-9-25
Author: Yiqing Xu, Licheng Liu
Maintainer: Yiqing Xu <yiqingxu@ucsd.edu>
Description: Generalized synthetic control method: causal inference with interactive fixed-effect models. It imputes counterfactuals for each treated unit using control group information based on a linear interactive fixed effects model that incorporates unit-specific intercepts interacted with time-varying coefficients. This method generalizes the synthetic control method to the case of multiple treated units and variable treatment periods, and improves efficiency and interpretability. Data must be with a dichotomous treatment but not necessarily in form of a balanced panel data.
